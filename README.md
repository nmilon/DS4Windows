DS4Windows is a Windows controller mapper maintained by hbashton. It reads
supported PlayStation and Nintendo controllers, applies per-profile mappings,
and presents the output expected by games. This fork continues the work of
Jays2Kings, Ryochan7, Schmaldeo, and the wider DS4Windows community.

This is the hbashton fork. Downloads, update checks, bug reports, and VIIPER
integration documented here all refer to hbashton repositories.

> **This checkout is a personal security-hardened fork of hbashton/DS4Windows.**
> Network listeners are pinned to loopback, the VIIPER and usbip-win2 downloads
> are verified against pinned SHA-256 hashes before they run, the elevated logon
> task no longer points at a user-writable binary, and there is an uninstall
> script. See [HARDENING.md](HARDENING.md). Report bugs here, not upstream,
> unless you have reproduced them on an unmodified build.

## Download and install

### Stable release

Most users should start with the stable build.

1. Open the [latest stable release](https://github.com/hbashton/DS4Windows/releases/latest).
2. Download `DS4Windows_<version>_x64.zip`. This VIIPER-based fork supports x64 Windows only.
3. Extract the entire `DS4Windows` folder to a permanent location such as
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DS4Windows` or `C:\Tools\DS4Windows`.
4. Run `DS4Windows.exe`. Do not run it from inside the ZIP archive.
5. Complete the first-run driver prompts, connect a controller, and select or create a profile.

For a one-file stable installer, download and run
[`ds4w.bat`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbashton/DS4Windows/main/ds4w.bat).
It installs the latest stable hbashton release to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DS4Windows`
and creates a desktop shortcut.

### DualSense and VIIPER preview

Native virtual DualSense output, advanced haptics, controller audio, and
microphone support are being released as VIIPER preview builds. These builds
appear as pre-releases on the
[DS4Windows Releases page](https://github.com/hbashton/DS4Windows/releases).
Choose the newest release whose tag begins with `VIIPER` when you want these
features.

> **VIIPER is x64 only.** VIIPER releases do not work with x86 Windows or the
> x86 DS4Windows build. Install the x64 DS4Windows package on a 64-bit Windows
> system before enabling any VIIPER output profile.

After installing a VIIPER-capable DS4Windows build:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Under **VIIPER Virtual Controller Support**, click **Install / Repair VIIPER**.
3. Accept the administrator prompt. The setup installs the hbashton VIIPER
   backend and the required `usbip-win2` driver.
4. Restart Windows if the setup installed or updated `usbip-win2`.
5. Edit a profile and select **DualSense**, **DualSense Edge**, **DualShock 4**,
   **Xbox 360**, or **Switch 2 Pro**. VIIPER is the backend for every virtual
   controller type; it is not repeated in the device names.

The installer also registers a hidden `RunVIIPER` task at sign-in. It starts
the backend elevated without a recurring console or UAC popup. DS4Windows
checks the backend at startup, starts it when possible, and opens a guided,
self-elevating repair flow when VIIPER or usbip-win2 is missing.

The matching VIIPER backend is published at
[hbashton/VIIPER](https://github.com/hbashton/VIIPER). Use DS4Windows' built-in
installer when possible so the backend and driver are placed and started
correctly.

## What this fork adds

### Profiles and automation

- Window-title-only Auto Profile rules for applications that do not expose a usable executable path.
- Duplicate Auto Profile rules with per-device matching for DualSense, DS4, DS3, Switch Pro, and Joy-Con controllers.
- An apply-to-all-controllers option for Auto Profiles.
- Per-profile Game Bar compatibility for DualSense outputs. It uses a
  temporary XInput companion only while the overlay is visible and does not
  change the loaded profile.
- Per-profile DualSense adaptive-trigger configuration and fixed full-pull trigger actions.
- More reliable profile transitions, including duplicate-rule crash and profile-switch latency fixes.
- Profile and Auto Profile search with live filtering and one-click clearing.
- Profile-scoped Audio Haptics and Trigger Lab settings.

### Controller output

- VIIPER virtual Xbox 360, DualShock 4, DualSense, DualSense Edge, and Switch 2 Pro output.
- Automatic migration of old Xbox 360 and DualShock 4 output selections to
  their VIIPER equivalents; ViGEmBus is not required.
- Native-style DualSense buttons, sticks, triggers, touch, gyro, accelerometer,
  lightbar, player LEDs, mute button, and Edge controls through VIIPER.
- Adaptive-trigger feedback forwarded from games to a physical DualSense or DualSense Edge.
- Advanced DualSense haptics transported from the virtual USB audio interface to a physical Bluetooth controller.
- Audio Haptics can capture the full system mix, an emulated-controller audio
  endpoint, or one selected running app (including its child processes) and
  turn it into profile-controlled DualSense haptic feedback.

### PlayStation controller audio

VIIPER preview builds expose Windows audio interfaces that match the virtual
DualSense or DualShock 4 selected by the profile. Supported paths include:

- Game or desktop audio sent to a physical DualSense or DualShock 4 speaker over
  Bluetooth, even when the emulated Sony controller is the other model.
- A virtual recording endpoint fed by the physical DualSense or DualShock 4
  microphone, with automatic conversion to the emulated controller's native
  capture format.
- Microphone level and noise-suppression controls.
- A profile option that lets the DualSense mute button mute and restore the
  microphone while keeping the recording stream active.

Audio, microphone, and advanced haptics support require matching DS4Windows and
VIIPER preview builds. They are not part of the current stable 4.0.2.x backend.

### Quality of life

- Automatic HidHide management for connected controllers, with per-profile
  control where direct passthrough is required.
- Improved long-path handling in Auto Profiles.
- Game Bar installation/elevation guidance and safer visibility detection.
- Update checks and updater downloads pointed at hbashton releases.
- Optional verbose logging and VIIPER diagnostics in preview builds.

## Interface tour

The redesigned interface keeps everyday controls easy to reach while preserving
the complete DS4Windows feature set for advanced users.

### Overview

Choose a connected controller and see its battery, connection, active profile,
emulated device, and output status at a glance. Quick profile controls let you
adjust rumble, output type, speaker routing, and microphone input without opening
the full profile editor.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/overview.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows Overview showing a connected DualShock 4 and quick profile controls">
</p>

### Controllers

Manage every connected controller from one screen. Each device card exposes its
active profile, HidHide state, battery level, lightbar color, and profile-linking
controls.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/controllers.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows Controllers screen with a connected DualShock 4">
</p>

### Audio Haptics

Turn the system mix, an emulated-controller endpoint, or one running app into
DualSense haptic feedback. Choose the source, strength, response curve, frequency
focus, ramp, fade, and whether the generated feedback mixes with or replaces
native game haptics.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/audio-haptics.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows Audio Haptics source and response controls">
</p>

### Trigger Lab

Build persistent adaptive-trigger effects for the active profile. Start with a
ready-made effect, tune its mode, start point, wall, and force, then preview it
before saving. L2 and R2 can be armed independently; **Linked** shares one effect
design, while **Split** restores separate settings for each trigger.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/trigger-lab.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows Trigger Lab with independent L2 and R2 effect controls">
</p>

### Profiles

Search, create, duplicate, rename, import, export, or delete controller profiles.
Profile cards provide a clear overview and open directly into the focused editor.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/profiles.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows searchable profile library">
</p>

### Profile editor and button mapping

Editing a profile opens a dedicated workspace for button mapping, special
actions, controller readings, axis curves, lighting, touchpad behavior, gyro,
Audio Haptics, Trigger Lab, and advanced settings. The controller map defaults
to the selected physical controller and can be changed without altering the
profile's emulated output.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/profile-editor.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows focused profile editor with controller-aware button mapping">
</p>

### Remapping dialog

Assign keyboard, mouse, media, macro, or virtual-controller actions. The diagram
matches the profile's emulated controller, and hovering a control highlights the
exact button target directly on the controller.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/remapping-dialog.png" width="900" alt="DS4Windows remapping dialog with the Cross button highlighted on a DualShock 4">
</p>

### Auto Profiles

Switch profiles automatically by executable path, window title, or controller.
Live search filters rules as you type, while the detail panel controls per-device
assignments, temporary controller shutdown, and fallback behavior.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/auto-profiles.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows Auto Profiles rules and per-controller assignments">
</p>

### Output Slots

Inspect the relationship between input controllers and virtual output devices.
The slot table shows the current and requested output modes and supports manual
plugging or unplugging when a fixed slot layout is needed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tour/output-slots.png" width="1000" alt="DS4Windows virtual controller output slots">
</p>

### Settings

Common startup, notification, charging, appearance, and update options stay in
the main Settings view. Diagnostic, networking, compatibility, device-support,
and backend tools remain available under the advanced sections.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11. VIIPER requires 64-bit Windows and the x64
  DS4Windows build. It is not compatible with x86 Windows.
- [Microsoft .NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
- [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
- [HidHide](https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide) is strongly recommended to
  prevent games from seeing both the physical and virtual controllers.
- `usbip-win2` and [hbashton/VIIPER](https://github.com/hbashton/VIIPER), installed through the built-in guided setup.

Supported physical inputs include first-party DualShock 4, DualSense,
DualSense Edge, DualShock 3, Switch Pro, and Joy-Con controllers. Some compatible
third-party and streamed virtual controllers are also supported when their HID
reports match a supported device type.

Moonlight/Sunshine virtual controllers are accepted when the corresponding
Device Options setting is enabled and Sunshine is running. DS4Windows still
rejects its own VIIPER outputs to prevent recursive virtual controllers.

## First setup

1. Install the required drivers when DS4Windows prompts for them.
2. In **Settings > Device Options**, enable any additional controller families you intend to use.
3. Connect the controller by USB or Bluetooth.
4. Create a profile or apply a preset.
5. Keep **Hide DS4 Controller** enabled when a game would otherwise see both the real and virtual devices.
6. Disable overlapping PlayStation or Xbox remapping in Steam for games managed entirely by DS4Windows.

Xbox Game Bar companion support requires DS4Windows to run elevated. VIIPER and
HidHide setup may also require administrator approval.

## Updating

The in-app update check reads releases from
[hbashton/DS4Windows](https://github.com/hbashton/DS4Windows/releases). Stable
builds do not automatically install prereleases.

For a manual update:

1. Close DS4Windows.
2. Extract the new release over the application folder.
3. Start DS4Windows again.

Profiles and logs are stored separately under `%APPDATA%\DS4Windows`, so
replacing the application folder does not normally remove user profiles. When
updating a VIIPER preview, run **Install / Repair VIIPER** again if the release
notes call for a matching backend update.

## Troubleshooting

- **A game receives double input:** install or repair HidHide, run DS4Windows as
  administrator, and confirm the physical controller is hidden while the
  virtual controller remains visible.
- **A VIIPER profile will not create an output:** open **Settings**, refresh the
  VIIPER status, run **Install / Repair VIIPER**, and reboot once if
  `usbip-win2` was installed.
- **Controller speaker or microphone is missing:** confirm you are using matching
  DS4Windows and VIIPER preview releases and that the profile uses a VIIPER
  DualSense, DualSense Edge, or DualShock 4 output.
- **Game Bar does not switch profiles:** install or repair Xbox Game Bar and run
  DS4Windows as administrator.
- **More diagnostics are needed:** enable **Verbose logging**, reproduce the
  issue once, and attach `%APPDATA%\DS4Windows\Logs\ds4windows_log.txt` to the
  bug report.

## Development

The solution targets .NET 8 and publishes x64 GitHub Actions builds. Pull
requests should keep stable behavior intact when adding preview backends and
should include focused tests for profile persistence, controller state, or
transport changes where practical.
